### 📘 API Documentation
Provides detailed RESTful and GraphQL API documentation following the **OpenAPI standard**. This ensures clarity and ease of integration for frontend developers, testers, and third-party services.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a first-class concern in the **Airbnb Clone Backend**. The following measures protect user data, payments, and platform integrity across REST and GraphQL interfaces.

### ✅ Authentication
- **What we use:** JWT (access/refresh tokens) or OAuth2; secure password hashing (Argon2/BCrypt); optional MFA.
- **Why it matters:** Verifies identity, prevents account takeover, and protects private resources (profiles, bookings, payments).

### 🛂 Authorization
- **What we use:** Role-Based Access Control (guest/host/admin) and object-level permissions (e.g., only the host can edit their property).
- **Why it matters:** Stops horizontal/vertical privilege escalation and prevents IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference).

### 📈 Rate Limiting & Throttling
- **What we use:** DRF throttles, IP/user-based limits, login attempt caps; caching via Redis.
- **Why it matters:** Preserves availability, reduces brute-force/login stuffing, and mitigates abuse/DDoS.

### 🔒 Transport Security (HTTPS/TLS)
- **What we use:** TLS 1.2+, HSTS, secure cookies, no mixed content.
- **Why it matters:** Encrypts data in transit (logins, payments) to prevent interception or tampering.

### 🧪 Input Validation & Query Safety
- **What we use:** DRF serializers/validators, parameterized queries via ORM, GraphQL query depth/complexity limits.
- **Why it matters:** Defends against SQLi, injection, over-fetching, and resource exhaustion.

### 🧰 Secrets & Config Management
- **What we use:** Environment variables, secret managers (e.g., Vault/SSM), no secrets in code/CI logs.
- **Why it matters:** Prevents credential leaks that could expose databases, payment processors, and infrastructure.

### 🧱 CORS, CSRF & Security Headers
- **What we use:** Strict CORS allowlists, CSRF protection for cookie-based auth, headers like CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options.
- **Why it matters:** Mitigates CSRF, clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and cross-origin data theft.

### 🔐 Data Protection at Rest
- **What we use:** Encryption at rest (DB/disk), field-level encryption for PII; least-privilege DB roles.
- **Why it matters:** Limits blast radius from storage breaches and protects sensitive user/payment data.

### 🧾 Auditing, Logging & Monitoring
- **What we use:** Structured logs, audit trails for auth and data changes, anomaly alerts; log redaction for PII.
- **Why it matters:** Detects intrusion, supports incident response, and meets compliance needs.

### 💳 Payment Security
- **What we use:** Tokenized payments via a PCI-DSS–compliant provider; webhook verification; idempotency keys for charges.
- **Why it matters:** Protects financial data, prevents double charges, and ensures trustworthy transactions.

### 📄 API Surface Hardening
- **What we use:** Minimal error messages, pagination to prevent enumeration, consistent resource scoping, disabled admin endpoints in prod.
- **Why it matters:** Reduces information leakage and prevents bulk data scraping.

### 🗂️ File & Media Safety
- **What we use:** Extension/MIME checks, AV scanning, signed URLs, isolated storage (e.g., S3) with least-privilege access.
- **Why it matters:** Blocks malicious uploads and protects user galleries/listing photos.

### 🧬 Dependency & CI/CD Security
- **What we use:** Dependency scanning (pip audit), pinning versions, SAST/DAST, signed images, Docker rootless runtime.
- **Why it matters:** Prevents supply-chain attacks and secures the delivery pipeline.

### 🔄 Background Jobs & Caching
- **What we use:** Celery task auth/signing, private Redis with auth/TLS, no secrets in task payloads.
- **Why it matters:** Ensures background processing and cache layers can’t be abused to exfiltrate data.

### 👥 Privacy & Compliance
- **What we use:** Data minimization, retention limits, user consent flows, right-to-delete/export hooks.
- **Why it matters:** Protects user privacy and supports regulatory obligations (e.g., GDPR-like controls).

**Security priorities across domains**
- **Protecting user data:** PII encryption, strict access controls, and minimal exposure.
- **Securing payments:** PCI-aligned flows, tokenization, and strong webhook verification.
- **Safeguarding bookings & listings:** Object-level permissions and audit trails to maintain integrity.
- **Maintaining availability:** Rate limits, caching, and monitoring to withstand abuse and spikes.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** are practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes.  
They ensure that new features, bug fixes, and updates are integrated into the project smoothly and reliably, reducing human error and speeding up development.

### Why It’s Important
Implementing CI/CD in the **Airbnb Clone Backend**:
- Ensures consistent code quality through automated testing.  
- Reduces deployment risks by validating each change before release.  
- Speeds up feature delivery and feedback cycles.  
- Provides a reliable, repeatable workflow from development to production.

### 🧰 Tools and Technologies
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates the CI/CD workflows, including testing, linting, and deployment.  
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent application environments across development, staging, and production.  
- **Docker Compose:** Orchestrates multi-container setups (e.g., Django, PostgreSQL, Redis) for integration testing.  
- **Celery + Redis:** Used in the background to process asynchronous tasks during deployment and testing.  
- **PostgreSQL:** Integrated in the testing pipeline to validate database interactions.  
- **Cloud Hosting (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Heroku):** For automated deployment of Dockerized builds to production environments.  

By leveraging CI/CD, the project achieves **rapid, reliable, and secure delivery** of backend updates with minimal downtime.
